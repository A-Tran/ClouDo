<a name="welcome-to-cloudo" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-cloudo"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to ClouDo</h3>

<p>The vision behind ClouDo starts with a goal. Several goals, actually. Several goals that people don't always have motivation to complete. Unless they have really good friends, who encourage them.</p>

<h3>
<a name="your-goals" class="anchor" href="#your-goals"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Your Goals</h3>

<p>ClouDo allows you to write any of your goals to your personal profile, and lets you keep track of your progress. Like a to-do list, but online. Hence, ClouDo. The cool part is that you get to share any or all (or none, but that's no fun) of your goals with your friends!</p>

<h3>
<a name="why-cloudo" class="anchor" href="#why-cloudo"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why ClouDo?</h3>

<p>ClouDo is awesome, that's why. Just kidding... (Not really.) By sharing your to-do list with your friends and family, a sense of responsibility over your list develops. Why? Because you've shared it with people. Now that your intentions are known by the people on your ClouDo network, you'll find it a lot harder to delay your tasks, forget about your tasks, or lie about completing them. With ClouDo, you can build another layer of motivation to achieve your goals, on top of what already exists.</p>
